The features describing these products include a list of their components, the cost of these components, and the total cost-to-manufacture. The label is the Recommended Retail Price (RRP) of the product. The owner of the production line has recently revealed a new product, but is not sure what price to recommend. Using your knowledge of kNN, write psuedo-code to describe the process by which the price could be decided based on the **single most similar product** that the production line currently manufactures.\n",
